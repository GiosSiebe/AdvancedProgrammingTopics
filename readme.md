# Microservices Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a microservices architecture with a focus on managing **users**, **moods**, **activities**, and **recommendations**. The backend is designed to allow users to explore activities based on their current mood, creating a personalized experience that enhances their well-being. The frontend complements this functionality, providing an intuitive user interface for interacting with the backend services.

## Microservices Architecture

The project consists of the following microservices:

1. **User Service**: Manages user accounts and authentication.
2. **Mood Service**: Allows users to post, update, and delete their moods.
3. **Activity Service**: Manages various activities available for users.
4. **Recommendation Service**: Generates recommendations based on user moods and selected activities.

### Technical Stack

- **Database**:
  - MongoDB: Used for storing user moods and activities.
  - MySQL: Used for storing user information and recommendations.
- **API Gateway**: All microservices interact through a Gateway configured with Spring Cloud Gateway. The gateway serves as a single entry point, handling load balancing, routing, and rate limiting.
- ***Gateway configurations*** 
  - Port: 8085
  - Security: GCP OAuth2 for user authentication, JWT verification for access control.
  - Redis Rate Limiter: Limits requests to prevent overloading with a replenish rate of 10 requests/second and a burst capacity of 20.

- **Authentication**: Implemented using GCP OAuth2 to secure endpoints.

## API Endpoints

### User Service
- **GET** `/users`: Retrieve all users.
- **POST** `/users`: Create a new user.
- **PUT** `/users/{id}`: Update user information.
- **DELETE** `/users/{id}`: Delete a user.

### Mood Service
- **GET** `/moods`: Retrieve all moods.
- **POST** `/moods`: Create a new mood.
- **PUT** `/moods/{id}`: Update a mood.
- **DELETE** `/moods/{id}`: Delete a mood.

### Activity Service
- **GET** `/activities`: Retrieve all activities.
- **POST** `/activities`: Create a new activity.
- **PUT** `/activities/{id}`: Update an activity.

- **GET** `/recommendations`: Retrieve recommendations based on user moods.
  
### Interaction between Services
The Recommendation Service interacts with both the Mood and Activity Services to generate tailored suggestions for users.

## Deployment

### Deployment Architecture
- **Docker**: Each microservice is containerized using Docker.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages the deployment of all services as a single application stack.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the build and deployment process of Docker containers.
